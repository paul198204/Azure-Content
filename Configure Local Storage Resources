Configure Local Storage Resources
--------------------------------------------------------------

A local storage resource is a reserved directory in the file system of the virtual machine in which an instance of a role is running. You can store information in your virtual machine instance so that code running in the instance can access the local storage resource when it needs to write to or read from a file. For example, a local storage resource can be used to cache data that may need to be accessed again while the service is running in Azure. You can also configure local storage resource to store files during startup. For more information on configuring local storage resources for startup, see Using Local Storage to Store Files During Startup

A local storage resource is declared in the service definition file. You can declare any number of local storage resources for a role. Each local storage resource is reserved for every instance of that role. The minimum amount of disk space that you can allocate for a local storage resource is 1 MB. The maximum amount that you can allocate for any given local resource depends on the size of the virtual machine that is specified for the role. Each virtual machine size has a corresponding total storage allocation, and the total space allocated for all local storage resources declared for a role cannot exceed the maximum size allotted for that virtual machine size. For more information about the maximum amount of local disk space that is allotted for each virtual machine size, see Configure Sizes for Cloud Services.


Adding a local storage resource
To declare a local storage resource within the service definition file, add the LocalResources element as a child of a WebRole element or the WorkerRole element. Then add a LocalStorage element to represent the resource. The LocalStorage element takes three attributes:

name
sizeInMB: Specifies the desired size for this local storage resource
cleanOnRoleRecycle: Specifies whether the local storage resource should be wiped clean when a role instance is recycled, or whether it should be persisted across the role life cycle. The default value is true.
The following service definition file shows two local storage resources that are declared for a web role:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ServiceDefinition xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ServiceHosting/2008/10/ServiceDefinition" name="MyService">
  <WebRole name="MyService_WebRole" vmsize="Medium">
    <InputEndpoints>
      <InputEndpoint name="HttpIn" port="80" protocol="http" />
    </InputEndpoints>
    <ConfigurationSettings>
      <Setting name="SimpleConfigSetting" />
    </ConfigurationSettings>
    <LocalResources>
      <LocalStorage name="localStoreOne" sizeInMB="10" />
      <LocalStorage name="localStoreTwo" sizeInMB="10" cleanOnRoleRecycle="false" />
    </LocalResources>
  </WebRole>
</ServiceDefinition>


Accessing a local storage resource programmatically
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To access the local storage resource, the application must retrieve the path from the GetLocalResource method. You can then use standard file read and write operations to read and write the contents of the local storage resource. For example, the following sample shows how to read the contents of a file called MyTest.txt from the local storage resource, and display it on the home page of an MVC 3 application:

using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime;
using System;
using System.Text;
using System.Web.Mvc;

namespace StartupExercise.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            string SlsPath = RoleEnvironment.GetLocalResource("StartupLocalStorage").RootPath;

            string s = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(SlsPath + "\\MyTest.txt");

            ViewBag.Message = "Contents of MyTest.txt = " + s;

            return View();
        }
    }
}
